  There is a popular belief even among Christians that we go to Heaven after we die and praise God for all eternity.  Not much is taught about how else things will exactly be like in Heaven, as much of it seems uncertain.  This prospect of the afterlife appeals little to many children and youth, who would consider it boring and like to think in more concrete ways and desire detail.  This document aims to provide this concrete detail to help those interested look more forward to the “blessed hope” (Tit 2:13) that awaits us in the future.  As we shall see, simply “worshiping God” in the afterlife is not the only thing that we will do and there is much to look forward to.</p>
<p>
All descriptions of the afterlife are grounded on both Scripture and good reason, and though it is impossible to avoid speculation about some questions, there are still some conclusions that can be known, some with more certainty than others.  It should also be noted, that this subject has been written about by plenty of capable authors in the past and in greater detail, but this document is an abbreviated discussion that tries to deal with some important and interesting questions.  Of course, this topic is also quite large and complicated and not everything that can be said about it will be said about it here.</p>
<p>
The Bible’s teaching concerning the time period leading up to the Antichrist, the tribulation the world will face, and the return of Jesus will not be covered here, as we are more interested in the condition of the world after these events, particularly in the Millennium (more on this topic below).
          </p>

          <p>
          <h2> Heaven and the Millennium </h2>
          </p>
<p>
When a Christian dies, it seems that he goes to Heaven or some sort of Paradise (Phil 1:23; Lk 23:43) to be with Jesus.  Perhaps we will see there other departed believers and angels too.  Since they have no physical bodies, perhaps we shall see them in some sort of visionary form or projection.  </p>
<p>
Whilst in Heaven, it should feel like rest (Heb 4:11; Rev 14:13) as it is a Paradise.  We don’t have much information about Heaven but it seems that some people will still think about Earth there - consider Rev 6:9-11 where dead believing martyrs want vengeance for their unjust deaths.  Though much of Revelation is symbolic and perhaps shouldn’t be taken literally, John didn’t at least seem to have a problem describing the already dead this way.  Perhaps then, other Earthly concerns won’t be forgotten either.</p>
<p>
We don’t stay permanently in Heaven though, as Jesus will eventually return to Earth (Mt 24:31) at which time all believers dead or alive will receive new physical bodies (Dan 12:2,13; 1 Cor 15:35ff; 1 Thess 4:13-18;) in a “twinkling of an eye” (1 Cor 15:52).  </p>
<p>
Note that according to Rev 20, dead Christian martyrs will be raised from the dead to live 1000 years on Earth after Jesus returns.  This belief, called premillennialism, though controversial and not without its difficulties, is what we believe is the best understanding of the text of Revelation, and was held to by many of the earliest Church fathers who wrote about the end-times.  But as all believers would have been raised from the dead or have new bodies at this point, to be with Jesus “forever” (1 Thess 4:17), it seems that all believers and not just martyrs will then live on Earth in the Millennium.</p>
<p>
As Rev 20:5 says, the other dead didn’t come to life until after the Millennium.  This would seem to mean that they are the wicked or unsaved dead.  Thus during this period the unsaved dead would not be in Heaven or Earth but held in some place like hell, to await judgement at the end (Rev 20:11).  The unsaved also seem to be raised from the dead to go into the “final hell” after this judgment, called the “second death” or “lake of fire” (Dan 12:2; Acts 24:15; Rev 20:14-15; 21:8). </p>
<p>
After the Millennium will be the New Heavens and the New Earth (Rev 21:1-22:5) or the Eternal State.  This state will go on forever (Rev 22:5) and seems to be an even better state than the Millennium (this will be discussed later).  Sometimes when the Bible talks about the end-times, it isn’t very clear whether it’s referring to the Millennium or the state after that.  But we shall try and be careful to say which passages describe which. </p>
<p>
More description of life in the Millennium will be given later.
          </p>
<p>
          <h2> The timing of the Judgment </h2>
          </p>
          <p>

The Bible teaches that there will be judgement of people after death or after the end of the world (Heb 9:26), but it seems to describe three judgments - the Sheep and the Goats (Mt 25:31-36), the “Judgment Seat of Christ” (2 Cor 5:10 - which in context seems to apply only to believers) and the Great White Throne Judgment (Rev 20:11-15).  It’s possible that these are all the same judgment just described in different and somewhat non-literal ways.  If so, the judgment would seem to occur at the end of the Millennium.</p>
<p>
Or maybe they are all different judgments which occur at different times - the Sheep and Goats judgment may happen at the beginning of the Millennium to decide who will enter it.  Since at this point all previously dead believers would have been raised from the dead to “be with the Lord forever” (1 Thess 4:17) , it would seem that the Sheep (who go into “eternal life” in Mt 25:46) include all believers dead and still alive at the beginning of the Millennium.  The Goats then are likely those unbelievers who didn’t treat Jesus or his followers properly (Mt 25:41-43).</p>
<p>
The Goats may comprise all unbelievers at the beginning of the Millennium or some.  If some, perhaps some unbelievers were not the ones that mistreated Jesus’ followers, and so don’t get to be judged as “goats”.  Fortunately for them, they then will be living with the Sheep (including resurrected believers) on Earth during this period.  We return to this point later.</p>
<p>
The judgment of 2 Cor 5:10, if different from the other judgments, may also happen after the Millennium sometime (perhaps at the beginning or end), when believers are judged.  But this is not a judgment of condemnation, but reward (1 Thess 2:29-20; Rev 22:12; Ps 62:12).  We will be rewarded in different degrees depending on how worthy our works are.</p>
<p>
Finally the Great White Throne judgment, if it’s a different judgment from the others, seems to be the judgment of all dead (and perhaps any alive remaining) unbelievers at the end of the Millennium, and perhaps also anyone else who hasn't already been judged.</p>
          </p>
          <p>
          <h2> Our new bodies </h2>
          </p>
<p>
Paul wrote quite a bit about our resurrection body in 1 Cor 15:35ff.  Our new bodies will be like Jesus’ body after he rose from the dead, for he is the ‘firstfruits’ of those who have died (1 Cor 15:20).  I don’t think that Jesus’ body literally shone with brilliant light (else this surely would have been mentioned in the Gospel accounts of his resurrection appearances like it was during his transfiguration), but it was nonetheless glorious (1 Cor 15:43).  We shall also be glorious and finally fully able to obey God (1 Cor 15:44) in our new body.  Human beings are created to have bodies, so to exist disembodied in Heaven is actually not the best state (2 Cor 5:4) and is inferior than having new bodies again.</p>
<p>
We will be imperishable or immortal (1 Cor 15:42).  This would imply no old age, or agelessness.  For the effects of old age like wrinkled skin, grey hair or senility are the effect of the Fall after Adam sinned (Gen 2:17; Gen 3:17-19) and now the effects of the curse of God are reversed (1 Cor 15:22; Rom 6:23) as it’s the “renewal of all things” (Mt 19:28-30).  Neither have I reason to think that Jesus appeared as an old man.  Likewise, sickness and disease should not affect us anymore, certainly to the extent of killing us.  And other diseases, like obesity or mental illness would surely not be part of a ‘glorious body’, nor would having an unhealthy body.</p>
<p>
The maimed, deformed and the ugly will be healed and restored and have beautiful faces and bodies, perhaps even more beautiful than they had in life.  But there would still be something about them that would make them recognizable to those that knew them in life, just as Jesus was recognized by his disciples, though there may still be degrees of beauty or handsomeness in the bodily form.</p>
<p>
Jesus’ body had to appear obviously human, and he even went to the extent of asking the disciples and Thomas to touch him and his stigmata (Lk 24:36-40; Jn 20:27).  He also seemed to have a stomach as he ate fish (Lk 24:41-43; Jn 21:13) and said he would one day drink wine again (Mt 26:29).  Thus, perhaps he may also possess other bodily organs that exercised their normal bodily functions.  We have no example of a resurrected and glorified female human, but there is no reason to think that human females wouldn’t be resurrected as females.  Though not risen to glory, neither Jairus’ daughter (Lk 8:40-56) nor Dorcas (Acts 9:36-42) rose from the dead as non-females.</p>
<p>
Jesus also seemed to have powers to teleport (Lk 24:36-43; Jn 20:19), and perhaps this could be one of our abilities also.  Nowhere except possibly in Jesus’ ascension is he said to fly (Acts 1:9), and his flying seems to be an act of God rather than a bodily ability of his.  Hence, I don’t expect we should be able to fly (at least unaided) in our resurrection bodies either.  If our bodies are to be glorified, I should expect to see our minds or intelligence also heightened, though perhaps not to the point of knowing all things like God, or instantly figuring out all answers to every question.  Perhaps our powers of memory will be increased too.</p>
<p>
Our bodies might be indestructible, though this seems too fantastic to imagine.  As we will see, the Millennium will be in some ways a return to Eden, and it would seem that not even in Eden were the bodies of Adam and Eve indestructible, as they needed to eat of the Tree of Life to be immortal (Gen 3:22).  Hence, it may be that we will still need food for nourishment, a topic to which we will return.  Thus if our bodies are not indestructible, perhaps we will be providentially shielded from harm by God or angels, or have superior healing powers, or even be raised from the dead again should we die by accident. </p>
          </p>
          <p>
          <h2> What will life be like in the Millennium? </h2>
          </p>
          
<p>
Many descriptions of what would seem to be the Millennium occur in the Old Testament prophets, like Is 2:1-5; 11; 54; 60-62; 65:17ff; 66:12ff; Jer 30-31; 32:36-33:26; Ezk 36-37; 39-48; Amos 9:11-15; Mic 4:1-7; Zech 8-10; 12-14.  Some might say that most of these descriptions are not to be understood literally but this is implausible as so many specific details are provided and there is no consistent way to apply the symbolism if they are all or mostly non-literal.  This is why many of the early Church fathers like Papias, Polycarp, Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Tertullian, Lactantius and others believed in the Millennium.</p>
<p>
It’s also possible that these passages refer to the Eternal State, or both the Millennium and Eternal State, and for the Christian it may not matter much.  But they are not usually understood as such as they seem to describe life after the restoration of the Kingdom of Israel, which is something that these and other prophecies describe will occur within the present world.  </p>
<p>
This is also why it is very doubtful that these prophecies describe anything happening now in the present or the past, as the present-day land of Israel does not fit these descriptions nor did it ever seem to in previous times.  God loves the Jewish people and still has plans for the Kingdom of Israel, and the Old Testament prophecies were of course given to the Jews at first, thus many of the prophecies in the Old Testament and even some in the New (e.g. Rom 11:25-32) concern Israel and its restoration, a very earthly hope.  </p>
<p>
Some passages too, describe things in the world that have already begun in part now like the New Covenant inaugurated by Jesus (Is 61:1-2 quoted in Lk 4:18-19, or Jer 31:31 quoted in Heb 8:8-12).  But they haven't been realized in full (like the rest of Is 61:4ff or Jer 31:38ff) and thus await future fulfillment.  Some of these passages also are taken to refer to the Millennium as they seem to describe things in the world that are not expected to exist in the Eternal State, like the continuing presence of a temple (like Ezk 40-48), sin or death (this shall be covered in more detail below), something not expected to exist in the Eternal State (Rev 21:4,22).</p>
<p>
2 Pet 3:7-12 says the “present heavens and earth” will be destroyed by “fire”.  Perhaps this occurs before the Millennium, or at its end with the final war (Rev 20:9), but in any case in the Millennium the earth will be “renewed” or “restored” (Mt 19:28-30).  The Lord (likely, acting through Jesus physically present on Earth) will be ruler of the world as king (Zech 14:9, Rev 20:4).  The “restoration” of the world is something like a return to the Edenic paradise in some ways (Is 11:6-9; Is 65:25) where animals and humans are no longer violent to each other.  Thus there will be peace in the land of Israel (Mic 4:4), and likely the whole world too.</p>
<p>
Other earthly activities described as occurring in the land of Israel include observing festivals (Ezk 45:21-23; Zech 8:19; 14:16), building houses, farming, planting vineyards (Is 65:21-22; Zech 8:12), shepherding flocks (Jer 33:13), fishing (Ezk 47:10), conducting temple rituals and temple sacrifices in a new temple (Ezk 40-48), playing (Zech 8:5), marrying (Jer 33:11) and giving birth to children (Is 65:20,23).  There will be topographical and environmental changes in the land of Israel (and possibly elsewhere on earth), like the split in the Mount of Olives near Jerusalem (Zech 14:4-10) or the freshening of the Dead Sea (Ezk 47:8).  Some Gentiles will live among the Jews in the land of Israel (Ezk 47:22-23).</p>
<p>
Some of these activities would seem not just limited to the land of Israel, but also the whole world.  Near the beginning of this time, after the final Tribulations of this age, activities like burning weapons (Ezk 39:9-10), burying bodies of the wicked (Ezk 39:12-14), and taking time to reconsecrate the temple (Dan 8:14,17) will be conducted.  All these activities take time to do, and aren’t immediately completed only by God, much like God giving Adam the task of (among other things) gardening (Gen 2:15).  </p>
<p>
These activities may be part of the job humans are given of “restoring” the Earth to its pristine state.  As we will be “beating swords into plowshares and spears into pruning hooks” (Mic 4:3), farming and burning weapons, the technological level in the Millennium will be at least agrarian, if not greater.  Perhaps more advanced technology will exist since it has already been discovered in this world.</p>
<p>
It is a topic for another study how the Millennial temple of Ezekiel differs from the Solomonic or the Herodian ones.  Though Millennial temple sacrifices seem strange in light of Jesus’ once and for all sacrifice (Heb 10:1-18), these sacrifices should be best understood to serve the memorial purpose of reminding people of Jesus’ sacrifice, much like how Communion serves a memorial function or how the sacrifices in the Old Testament pointed forward to Jesus’ ultimate sacrifice (note that Paul in Acts 21:22-26 also had no problem with participating in temple purification rites or offerings even after Jesus’ death).  Also, this temple and its rituals may serve as a vindication of God’s original plan with Israel, for it is during the Millennium that Israel finally can become the nation it was meant to be (though it has never yet lived up to its intended purpose).</p>
<p>
The earth will have increased knowledge and worship of God (Is 11:9; 65:23; Zech 8:20-23), though there still seems to be the presence or possibility of sin even if it is greatly diminished compared with what exists in the present world.  For example, if people prophesy falsely they will be executed (Zech 13:3), if they do not go to Jerusalem to worship the Lord they will have no rain (Zech 14:18) and the Lord will judge disputes between nations and peoples (Is 2:4; Mic 4:3).  </p>
<p>
There will be people being born with much increased longevity, though still seemingly with the possibility of dying (Is 11:8; Is 65:20; Zech 8:4-5).  The life spans might be like what they were before the flood (Gen 4).  Given that resurrected believers will no longer die (as discussed previously), it seems these people will be descendants of the people who were able to enter the Millennial kingdom (whether glorified believers or non-glorified people or both) who will not be immortal or glorified, but still have greatly increased lifespans and possess a choice to serve God or not.  The world will thus increase in population.  </p>
<p>
This also makes sense in light of Rev 20:8-9, as these seem to be the same group of people some of whom Satan will deceive at the end of the Millennium, since it is unlikely that already resurrected and glorified believers, who have already made their choice in this life and will be with the Lord “forever” at his return (1 Thess 4:17), will rebel against God at the end of the Millennium.  It isn't until after the Millennium that “death will be no more” (Rev 21:4).</p>
<p>
There is little information about what language we will speak.  Note that the post-resurrection Jesus spoke the common language of his day to his disciples.  So perhaps we shall continue speaking the languages with which we are familiar, though we have more time and ability to learn new languages.  Or perhaps we might be able to instantly know all languages as we are filled by the Holy Ghost (like at Pentecost in Acts 2), or we may all be able to communicate in at least one common language to start with, perhaps the pre-Babel tongue (Gen 11:1).</p>
<p>
Likely we shall continue to eat food of both the plant and meat variety, given the above verses on farming and planting vineyards and fishing.  Other verses that seem to support eating are Is 25:6; Mt 8:11 and Rev 19:6-9.  Moreover, as temple sacrifices continue wherein animals like cows are slain, it’s also possible we shall be able to eat other meats or animal products too, or perhaps at least some equally tasty substitute.</p>
<p>
It might be asked, why is it necessary to eat if we’re already glorified and immortal?  We have answered this question in part already, that may we still need it for nourishment.  Also, it may be an activity done for the sake of pure enjoyment, or as the means by which people gather together for fellowship (as is so often done even in our present world).  Rom 14:17 does not contradict this; in context the passage is talking about not offending or judging fellow Christians based on what they eat and how the most important characteristics of those that enter the kingdom of God are righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.  It doesn’t mean that food will be abolished, since we already see verses that suggest otherwise.</p>
<p>
During the Millennium, believers will rule and reign in the kingdom (2 Tim 2:12; Rev 20:4), which likely means they will do man’s job of exercising dominion over the world as originally and divinely intended (Gen 1:28), and would also seem to imply that we will have administrative duties in the Millennial government; the degree of our responsibility or rule depending on how faithful stewards we were in this life (Mt 25:23; Lk 19:11-27).  Some like the disciples will judge other Israelites (Mt 19:28) and we will even judge angels (1 Cor 6:3), though this might occur at the end of the Millennium when the Devil is finally thrown into the Lake of Fire (Rev 20:10).  </p>
<p>
It is doubtful that we will find our life or work boring or meaningless.  Present day work can be toilsome and boring due ultimately to human sinfulness - apparently wasted effort (due to accidents, natural disaster etc), unnecessarily hard labor (Gen 4:17-18), stressful demands on time due to the reality of death and aging, lack of appreciation, interpersonal problems etc.  But in the Millennium sin is greatly diminished, the world is at peace and work will not be burdensome or stressful.  People will be more loving so there will be appreciation of work and one will find oneself always in the presence of a loving community and a loving and near God (Is 65:24), who is the best father and friend one could possibly have.</p>
<p>
There may be other work one will do beside the job of just “ruling” or “administering” God’s kingdom (e.g. building houses, planting vineyards etc - see above), and all of these will be meaningful.  God may also see to it that one will always face interesting challenges and new goals to offset boredom, and have plenty of opportunities for exploring new and different activities, places or tasks including leisure time (like fishing Ezk 47:10), and perhaps also new opportunities to be rewarded more by God.  Many of the problems that also hinder productive work, like disease, addictions, neuroses, anxiety etc will not exist, and we will have healthy minds and bodies in whatever work we do.  </p>
<p>
These considerations hopefully will encourage those who may be tempted to view eternal life as leading to boredom.  In any case, this is better than the alternative of no immortality, in which one will eventually go extinct, never again to return to enjoy the relationships one had or works of one’s hands (Ps 90:17).  </p>
<p>
I’d like to think, that each day will be even better than the one before, and as different people will have their own recompense and reward, perhaps the joy of some will also increase more than those of others with time.  Perhaps another factor in our joy will also be finally seeing the reason for our sufferings on earth and how they were worth bearing in the grand scheme of things (2 Cor 4:17). </p>
<p>
It can be seen then, that the Millennium seems at times a strange “mixed” world containing both glorified and non-glorified human beings and combining both heavenly or edenic elements and earthly or post-Fall elements.  Some might wonder why God would ever have the world become this way?  The answer perhaps is, because this is a world where sin has already entered it, where people have already died and where God already has made promises to restore Israel to become the nation it should have been.  The world during the Millennium may be the best compromise or way of accommodating these past realities whilst still making it much better than the previous world.  To truly restore or change the world to one which resembles or exceeds the Edenic Paradise may require waiting until the Eternal State (where the Tree of Life will again exist Rev 22:2).</p>
<p>
After the Millennium, the “kings of the earth will bring their glory into it” (Rev 21:24) i.e. the Eternal State.  The glory of kings must include the glory of the nations they were ruling under, which would thus seem to include all the best things those nations ever produced - their food, music, arts, poetry, culture etc.  Perhaps this can already begin in part during the Millennium.  </p>
          <p>
          <h2> What will relationships with each other be like in the Millennium? </h2>
          </p>
<p>
Disagreements between people in this life exist because of misunderstandings due to poor communication, lack of access to all pertinent information, mental problems and because our thinking is darkened by sin to a degree (Eccl 9:3; Jer 17:9; Mt 15:19; Rom 1:21).  In the Millennium one should expect much more harmony between people as these ill effects are greatly diminished, if not completely absent, and we will know even more things that we don’t understand now (1 Cor 13:10,12).  It is during this time that Jesus’ prayer for unity of the believers (Jn 17:20-23) will be at last realized, or at least much closer to fulfillment.</p>
<p>
Thus many disagreements should be expected to be resolved in the Millennium, though this may be something that takes time to do and requires learning (perhaps, partly through supernatural illumination by God).  Some disagreements may still exist even in the Millennium (Is 2:4; Mic 4:3). But as Satan will no longer be present on Earth during the Millennium to deceive the nations (Rev 20:3), there will be much more peace on Earth.</p>
<p>
We may be quite surprised at who does or doesn’t make it into the Millennium, or what the degree of rewards would be for those who do enter it (Mt 19:30; 20:16), for only God knows the motives of our heart (Prov 16:2; 1 Cor 4:5).</p>
<p>
It seems unlikely that God, being a merciful and loving God and father (Ex 34:6; Deut 4:31; Mt 6:9; 1 Jn 4:7-21), would eternally condemn those young children who died and who never knew right from wrong nor the choice to reject God.  Thus, one can hope that they too will be raised from the dead in the Millennium to live on Earth.  They may be among the ones that God decides to glorify and grant immortality, or they may be given their chance to make a choice for or against him during the Millennium.  </p>
<p>
Given that after death, one’s soul does not age biologically (and without a brain, perhaps one’s mental faculties also don’t advance), it may be that the children are raised to life to be at the age they physically died and thereafter grow up, which may be a comfort to some grieving parents.  God may give some of these children to new parents if their biological parents do not enter the Millennium.</p>
<p>
We may say similar things about those invalids and mentally infirm who have died.  For those invalids who became so afflicted later in life, I should think God will judge them rightly on the basis of who they were and what they did prior to becoming mentally infirm, so some of them may also find themselves resurrected in the Millennium to glorified immortality or be given a chance to choose for or against God.</p>
<p>
There is little information about whether our beloved pets who have died will be resurrected to keep us company, much less if they will live on forever after that.  Still Isaiah speaks of animals living in harmony in Is 11:6-9; 65:25.  Why should there not be an increase of animals in the Millennium?  If God is a loving and all-powerful father and if our pets matter that much to us, why should he not wish to have them finally rejoin us in the life to come, if that would make our happiness even greater?   </p>
<p>
In many cases though certain relationships will not continue e.g. we may not see the unbelieving friend or relative who wasn’t worthy to enter the Millennium (and who thus is in hell).  Or, because of separation by untimely death, certain relationships that we would have had and the memories of those relationships do not exist e.g. two brothers who would have grown up from childhood together but didn’t as one died young, but who are still reunited in the resurrection.  These type of losses don’t seem to be the type that can be done away with or easily forgotten.</p>
<p>
One answer to the problem of our unsaved relatives or friends would be to say that we shall have plenty of time and opportunities for other relationships with other loving people in the Millennium, that can over time make up for the loss to some degree.  Jesus said that anyone “who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for my sake will receive a hundredfold” (Mt 19:29).  This may seem to mean that we have other relationships we can possess that will assuage our loss to an extent.</p>
<p>
We should also recognize that our unbelieving friends and relatives reject God out of their own choice (which is not God’s will - 1 Tim 2:4; 2 Pet 3:9), and likely as they continue in hell and persist in their rebellion (Rev 9:20; 16:11) they become even more evil and wretched, so that whatever good from a relationship we may have had with them in this life will eventually disappear, and it may no longer be desirable to continue a relationship with them anyway even if it were possible to speak and visit with each other in the Millennium. </p>
<p>
And in the case of friends or relatives who were separated by untimely death, they have plenty of time to know each other again and deepen their relationship, which will eventually make up for their not having memories of knowing each other as they would have known in this life.  And since in the Millennium people will be far more loving and empowered by the Holy Spirit to better follow God’s commands (Jer 31:33; Ezk 36:26), this will only be an ever-sweeter relationship with time.</p>
<p>
It may be that our sadness at these kinds of losses isn’t instantly forgotten or wiped away when we die or are resurrected, for that would have God altering our memories or identities in seemingly too disruptive a fashion.  Recall that even the souls of the martyrs haven’t forgotten their unjust deaths (Rev 6:10) and are even impatiently awaiting their vengeance from the Lord.</p>
<p>
Our tears - some of which may be even tears of regret - are not wiped away until after the Millennium (Rev 21:4), and even then it still seems that we require continual “healing” from the Tree of Life (Rev 22:2).  Perhaps what this means is that with the passage of time our griefs do diminish to an ever smaller degree, even if they are never totally forgotten or ignored.  Of course, the greatest sources of grief and mourning i.e. death (Rev 21:4), will be mostly done away with even during the Millennium.</p>
<p>
A puzzling saying of Jesus is his statement that people will “neither marry nor be given in marriage” in the resurrection (Mk 12:24-27; Mt 22:30; Lk 20:35), which seems to indicate some major change in interpersonal relationships compared to our experience in this life.  These words might trouble those who are happily married, though they may also be a comfort to those in unhappy or mismated marriages.</p>  
<p>
Whatever this saying means, we must remember that “eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor has it entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for those who love him” (1 Cor 2:9).   God, who by definition must be good to be worthy of the title, will as far as possible make his recompense fitting and worth it e.g. God promises even more “children to the barren woman” (Is 54:1) and a “memorial and a name better than sons and daughters” to the eunuch (Is 56:5).</p>
<p>
But given that we’ve seen above some hints in the Bible of the continued presence of both childbirth and even marrying in the Millennial age, and considering that marriage is a pre-Fall institution that God had pronounced “very good” (Gen 1:31) by which God “joins together” two people (Mk 10:9) into “one flesh”, it may be that Jesus is speaking more of the abolishment of levirate marriage (which is the immediate context of his dialogue with the Sadducees and which certainly would cease if people were immortal), or marriage “as we know it” in the present sinful age, with all its worldly ceremony, custom and expectations.  </p>
<p>
The union of two people in love during the Millenium might then continue, much like Adam and Eve were simply joined prior to the Fall (Gen 2:22-25) without all the post-Fall custom and traditions that have since existed in marriages.  For in the resurrection, love will be intensified and deepened and will no longer be of the carnal, selfish or lustful kind (as it is often in this life), and will remain quite apart from any ceremony or recognition by earthly government.</p>
<p>
As Charles Kingsley (chaplain to Queen Victoria) noted, we may have no rule to say for some couple or pair of lovers how it may or may not continue on in the resurrection, particularly in those cases where someone had remarried after the death of their spouse.  But this problem, which isn’t experienced by all (or maybe even most) in this life anyway, we can leave in the hands of a good God to resolve. </p>   
<p>
It has also been discussed above that Jesus did possess what seemed to be a normal human body with normal functioning organs and members.  Although Justin Martyr thought that the sexual function of the reproductive organs would thereby cease in the Resurrection, it would seem more plausible that there would still be the possibility and eventuality of their being used by at least some humans as designed originally by God i.e. to beget offspring in the Millennium at least (Is 11:8; 65:20).  It seems strange that something like eating can continue in the Resurrection and not the love or love-making between man and woman.  There seems to be no reason to limit the number of living beings that can exist, especially for a God who can surely find ways to deal with overpopulation. </p>
<p>
Though believers are all “brothers and sisters” even now (Mt 12:48-50; Rom 12:10; 1 Tim 5:1-2) in one sense - as co-heirs in the kingdom of God and his children (Gal 3:26-29) - our relationships with each other still have differences in both type and degree - your mother isn’t my mother, your son isn’t my son etc, and relationship with God isn’t a substitute for human relationships and vice versa. </p> 
<p>
Even God the Father may have a special and different relationship with the Son than he does with humans (God loves all impartially, universally and unconditionally, but perhaps not equally in degree).  And as far as we know, Jesus still had the same relationships after his resurrection with his disciples, siblings and mother - he was still their teacher, brother or son (and of course Lord).  Hence in the Millennium why wouldn’t one also expect to have different forms of companionship (including of the romantic kind) and different degrees of affection?  </p>

        <p>  <h2> The alternatives to this hope </h2></p>
<p>
In no other religion is the hope of life after death both so concrete and physical, and also so well-evidenced.  Jesus is not just some mythical person who existed in a mythical time and place but a real historical person whose resurrection from the dead we have good evidence for.  His disciples, who concluded he was the Lord because they thought they witnessed him alive from the dead, all were willing to die for him (and most did).  The resurrection of Jesus and our future bodies also show that the material realm is indeed a good thing and not something to be abolished in the afterlife or world to come. </p>
<p>
In Islam, there is also a resurrection of the body after death, but the evidence for Christianity is far superior.  Though more can be said about this, Islam came many centuries after Christianity and teaches that Jesus wasn’t crucified (Surah 4:157-158), which is contradicted by historical evidence.  </p>
<p>
On Judaism there is also a resurrection since it shares many of the same scriptures as Christianity, but the big difference between modern day versions of Judaism and Christianity are their beliefs regarding Jesus and whether or not he is the Messiah.  One can expand greatly on this topic, but in brief, there is excellent reason to think that he is as he fulfills many of the Old Testament prophecies concerning Messiah, and his claims regarding himself are vindicated by his own resurrection.</p>
<p>
On atheism, there is even less hope, for one ceases to exist after one dies.  You experience no afterlife, no bodily resurrection and certainly no paradise.  This would seem to make present life meaningless.  Everyone will die anyway, and why will the fact that you once existed in the universe matter or give your life meaning and purpose now?  The universe doesn’t care.  In any case, there is evidence for both the existence of God and for the resurrection of Jesus.</p>
<p>
The description of the Christian Millennium described here shares many similarities with those heretical versions of Christianity like those of the Jehovah’s Witnesses.  Not all their beliefs are incorrect, though a discussion of their errors from orthodox Christianity is a topic for another time.</p>
<p>
          <h2> A call to action </h2></p>
<p>
It is hoped that the above descriptions encourage those who previously may not have looked forward much to the Christian afterlife.  May this vision of the afterlife increase our desire to see unbelievers, especially those unbelieving friends and family, also “be accounted worthy to obtain that world and to the resurrection of the dead” (Lk 20:35) and cause us to be more fervent in helping to preach this good news of the world to come to them (Rom 10:15).</p>
<p>
May this article encourage the reader to not “grieve like the rest of mankind, who have no hope” in the face of death (1 Thess 4:13) and also spur the reader on to work out even more diligently their own salvation (Phil 2:12) and make every effort to live a life worthy of their calling (Eph 4:1; 2 Pet 1:10), as they look forward to the day of God (2 Pet 3:12) and the future life that “is truly life” (1 Tim 6:19).  Maranatha and Amen.  </p>
<p>
          <h2> Addendum - The Economics of the Millennium </h2></p>
<p>
There isn’t much information in the Bible about the economics of the Millennium, but as many aspects of economics (and interpersonal interactions between humans) now are predicated on the reality of human limitations and evil, suffering and death, one should expect substantial changes to economics in the Millennium if human morality, abilities and life expectancy are enhanced.  </p>
<p>
For example, costs for transportation may be low or non-existent if we could teleport around, or likewise with healthcare-related costs if glorified people are immune to disease, injury or death.  Perhaps many individuals will be far more self-sufficient and thus not dependent on business transactions with others as they then possess advanced intelligence to render superfluous many economical activities which are engaged in now.  If there still is a monetary system or property ownership, safeguards against theft, counterfeiting or forgery may be more minimal or non-existent as the populace will be all or mostly honest and righteous.  Human law enforcement and military power may be greatly diminished (cf. Mic 4:3), and political peace and stability will be ensured by a powerful supernatural ruler (the Lord - Ps 2:9, Rev 2:27) who will even control the weather (Zech 14:17) to ensure compliance.</p>
<p>
But as long as certain resources (be it time, land, construction materials, food etc) still have some scarcity in the Millennium and are in demand, some form of economic activity would be expected to continue.  It has been established in the preceding article that it doesn’t seem that God would be expected to do or provide everything for everyone immediately (neither did he this in the garden of Eden).  For one definition of economics is ‘the allocation of scarce resources which have alternative uses’.  Resources could be allocated via a barter system perhaps, or take more advanced forms (like physical or digital money) depending on the level of technology in the Millennium.  </p>
<p>
That the Millennium will be a time of heightened prosperity at least in Israel is clearer e.g. Jer 31:14; 33:9 speaks of peace, abundance and bounty, Ezk 36:11,29,35 describe fruitfulness, plentiful grain and crops and the formerly desolate land now being like “the garden of Eden”.  Ezk 47:12 speaks of “fruit trees of all kinds” growing whose “leaves will not wither, nor will their fruit fail” whose fruit serves for food and leaves for healing (language reminiscent of Rev 22:2).  Similar sentiments are seen in Zech 8:12. </p>
<p>
Amos 9:13 has the Lord describing how harvesters will be overtaken by planters with wine flowing “from all the hills”.  It is descriptions like these which probably inspired the imagination of early chiliasts like Irenaeus who (perhaps with some hyperbole) wrote that during the Millennium “creation, having been renovated and set free, shall fructify with an abundance of all kinds of food, from the dew of heaven, and from the fertility of the earth”, even writing that “the days will come, in which vines shall grow, each having ten thousand branches, and in each branch ten thousand twigs, and in each true twig ten thousand shoots, and in each one of the shoots ten thousand clusters, and on every one of the clusters ten thousand grapes, and every grape when pressed will give five and twenty metretes of wine. And when any one of the saints shall lay hold of a cluster, another shall cry out, I am a better cluster, take me; bless the Lord through me” (Adv. Haer. Bk. V Ch. 33 - which is itself a quote from Papias)!</p>
<p>
Given these passages on the abundance in the Millennium, it seems that the scarcity of many resources (in particular basic resources like food) will be non-existent or nearly so during that age.  If there is still a Millennial economy then, this should at minimum have the effect of significantly lowering costs for such resources (and other resources, industries and businesses dependent on them), so that many things will be very affordable and obtainable and “everyone will sit under their own vine and under their own fig tree” (Mic 4:4).</p>
<p>
Some hint of continued economic activity in the Millennium may also be seen in passages like Is 60, Jer 32:44 and Zech 14:14 which speak of Israel or Zion becoming very “rich” due to the wealth or riches of nations coming into it, whether it be through plunder from the wars preceding the Millennium, or through economic prosperity during the Millennial age.  These passages seemingly portray Israel as financially prosperous, if not also the centre of world economic and commercial (and certainly religious) activity, and if Jer 32:44 also applies to that period, then it explicitly mentions economic transactions like the signing of contracts and exchange of currency for real estate.</p>
<p>
It has been established previously that the Millennial world government will be ultimately monarchical with Jesus as its head and the saints also ruling with and under him to various degrees.  Whether their portfolios can change over time, or whether politics at a lower level will accomodate more democratic systems in some instances, is unknown, though perhaps still possible.  The theocratic and monarchical system of government is in this case the optimum form as the dictator is indisputably benevolent and righteous (as are the authorities under him).</p>
<p>
Given that the Millennium will be much more of an actual utopia and its government righteous (and also its citizens to a large or even complete degree), perhaps it also won’t matter so much whether any economic activity involved in obtaining land, building houses, farming etc (such activities as described earlier taking place in the Millennium) occurs under either a more socialistic or free-market type system.</p>
